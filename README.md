What the NSFW code below turned into.

Refactoring of the extension is done. Honestly really surprised with how long it took. After the initial struggle of having to read my old code to figure out which elements were being interacted with, I was quickly able to divide up the functions into different components and work on them modularly, unlike how it was before. I'm really happy with the end product as it is just simply faster and the code is much more elegant/clean instead of spaghetti. I didn't take any shortcuts at all and refactoring with the intent of every single line of code in the extension being important and necessary. I feel like a 4 year burden has been lifted and am honestly pretty impressed with how much better my new version is.

why

This was my first ever chrome extension. I was still learning js and decided I wanted to add a feature to a website I used a lot when playing league. After about a good month of off and on coding(if you even consider this coding), I published it on the chrome web store and surprisingly a lot of people also found the tool useful. ~2k people downloaded it the first day so I was inspired to fix the code and started working on it "the next day".

4 years later, today is the next day. The code for this extension ALWAYS bothered me, even while writing it. I knew the stuff I did was not going to last and was just desperate to get it finished and working, because it was my first extension. I'm honestly surprised it was able to last(and still is) and I should just be really lucky that op.gg didn't redesign their frontend.

Anyway, I've decided to refactor the extension and I'll see what happens. It's only been a day and I can't look at the code for more than a minute without getting an aneurysm, so we'll see how far I can get.
