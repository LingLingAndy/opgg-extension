![code snippet of my disgusting extension](https://i.imgur.com/CFt42ku.png)
why

This was my first ever chrome extension. I was still learning js and decided I wanted to add a feature to a website I used a lot when playing league. After about a good month of off and on coding(if you even consider this coding), I published it on the chrome web store and surprisingly a lot of people also found the tool useful. ~2k people downloaded it the first day so I was inspired to fix the code and started working on it "the next day".

4 years later, today is the next day. The code for this extension ALWAYS bothered me, even while writing it. I knew the stuff I did was not going to last and was just desperate to get it finished and working, because it was my first extension. I'm honestly surprised it was able to last(and still is) and I should just be really lucky that op.gg didn't redesign their frontend.

Anyway, I've decided to refactor the extension and I'll see what happens. It's only been a day and I can't look at the code for more than a minute without getting an aneurysm, so we'll see how far I can get.
